There are a few ways to exit insert mode

- Press the Esc key
- Press Ctrl + [
- Press Ctrl + C

These keystrokes are not very fast, and we can make them faster by remapping jj to Esc in insert mode.

inoremap jj <esc>

You can enter this directly in to your command line to test it out.

The command line acts as a Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) for Vimscript. You can enter commands and see the results immediately.

It is a good iead to add 

inoremap jj <esc>

to your .vimrc file so that it is loaded every time you start Vim.
