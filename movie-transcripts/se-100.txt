SE 100

There's one strong rule and one soft rule in this course.

The strong rule is to learn the material as fast as you can and to the best of your ability, using any strategy that suits you.
That means focus on the material that will make you a better programmer, and skip over anything that bores you or you don't think is useful.

The soft rule is that to complete the course you must meet with me for a technical interview so that I can confirm that you can perform each task you need to know to move to the next course.

The soft rule is soft because I leave it up to you to decide when to move to the next course and you may want to move to the next course first and then circle back for the assessment.
