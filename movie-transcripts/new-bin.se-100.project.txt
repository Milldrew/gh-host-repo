When you type a command into the command line the shell looks for a program that matches the name of the command you typed.

Where does the shell look for programs?

The shell looks for programs in directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

A path variable looks like this: PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

The PATH variable is a colon separated list of directories that the shell will search in order to find a program that matches the command you typed.

Create a new directory in your home directory called core-bin

mkdir ~/core-bin

Add the core-bin directory to your PATH variable

In the .zshrc file add the following line:

export PATH=$PATH:~/core-bin

now move your terminal user interface program cat-says to the core-bin directory

mv cat-says ~/core-bin

Now you can run the cat-says program from anywhere in the terminal

cat-says

you now have a new bin you can use to organize your programs

As you accumulate more and more programs you can add more directories to your PATH variable

For example you could create a bin called git-bin, for your porgamrs that use the git command.
