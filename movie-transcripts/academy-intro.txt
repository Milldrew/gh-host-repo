Learning Software Engineering is similar to learning how to play the Piano, except for instead of creating sound, you are creating program files, and instead of pressing piano keys you are pressing keyboard keys.

Like becoming a good pianist becoming a good Software Engineer requires consistent practice over a long time, muscel mememory, and a good teacher.

It usually takes a minimum of 2 years of consistent practice to become a good Software Engineer. Please refer to the Cal Newport book Deep Work for information about good studying habits.
