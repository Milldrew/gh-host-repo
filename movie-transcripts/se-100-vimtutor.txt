Vimtutor is a tutorial that comes with vim.

To become a great vim user you need to complete this tutorial several times.

Although you do not need to do every exercise in the tutorial, you should seek out the ones that you find interesting and do those exercises.

I recommend that you scroll using Ctrl+D to go down and Ctrl+U to go up.

Or if you want a smooth scroll use Ctrl+E to go down and Ctrl+Y to go up.

I recommend that you turn on the number line by typing :set number.

This way when you find an exercise you like you can write down the line number and come back to it later.

By typing the line number into the command line
Or using the G command to go to a specific line number.

Vim is a corner stone of software development. And you will naturally want to become a master of it.
If you get bored of the tutorial, you can always come back to it later.
