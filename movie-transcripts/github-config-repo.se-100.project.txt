cd ~
echo "# my.configs" >> README.txt
git init
git add README.txt
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Milldrew/my.configs.git
git push -u origin main

create the files if they dont exist
touch ~/.vimrc ~/.zshrc ~/.tmux.conf ~/bin

git add ~/.vimrc  ~/.zshrc ~/.tmux.conf ~/bin
git commit -m "added config files and bin directory"
git push

Go to your github account and check out your new repository.
